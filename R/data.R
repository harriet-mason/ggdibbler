#' A toy data set that provides data for a map with the temperature of each area represented by a random variable.

#' A toy data set that has the ambient temperature as measured by a collection of citizen scientists for each Iowa county
#'
#' There are several measurements for each county, with no location marker

#'  different numbers of observations as well as a different levels of variance
#'  between the observations in the county.

#' An uncertain version of the MPG data from `ggplot2`
#' 
#' This dataset is based on the Fuel economy data from 1999 to 2008 from `ggplot2`, 
#' but every value is represented by a distribution. Every variable in the data set
#' is represetned by a categorical, discrete, or continuous random variable. The
#' original MPG dataset in ggplot is a real a subset of the fuel economy data from 
#' the EPA, but the uncertainty is hypothetical uncertainty for each data type, added
#' by us for illustrative purposes.

#' An uncertain version of the mtcars data from base R `datasets`

#' This dataset is identical to the mtcars data, except that every  variable in the data set
#' is represented by a categorical, discrete, or continuous random variable. The

#' An uncertain (and shrunk down) version of the diamonds data from`ggplot2`

#' This dataset is a subset of the diamonds data. There is a deterministic version that is only
