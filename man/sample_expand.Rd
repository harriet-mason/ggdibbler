\title{Simulate outcomes from dibble to make a tibble}
\usage{
sample_expand(data, times)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Distribution dataset to expand into samples}

\item{times}{The number of values sampled from each distribution in the data set.}
}
\description{
Simulates outcomes from all distributions in the dataset to make an "expanded" data
set that can be intepreted by ggplot2. This can be used to debug ggdibbler plots, or
used to make an uncertainty visualisation for a geom that doesn't exist.
