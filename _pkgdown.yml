- title: Position
  desc: |
    These positions allow you to nest the distribution overplotting within a different ggplot2 position adjustment
  contents: starts_with("position_")
- title: Scale
  desc: |
    These scales support allow distributions to be passed to ggplot with ease.  They identify the scale type needed, and allow you to personalise the  limits/labels of continuous x and y axis.

- title: Data
  desc: |
    ggdibbler comes with a handful of data sets with uncertain values to show the use of the package. Most of these datasets are ggplot2 datasets with uncertainty added in.
