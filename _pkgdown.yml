    The uncertainty equivalent of the ggplot geom functions. This is how
    you will typically interact with ggdibbler, as it is how you usually
    interact with ggplot2.

- title: Stats
  desc: >
    This is where most of the methods used to make uncertainty visualisation
    in ggdibbler work. These stat functions convert a distribution to a sample
    before running through their non-uncertainty counterpart.

- title: Scale
  desc: >
    These scales support allow distributions to be passed to ggplot with ease. 
    They identify the scale type needed, and allow you to personalise the 
    limits/labels of continuous x and y axis.

- title: Data
  desc: >
    ggdibbler comes with a handful of data sets with uncertain values to show the
    use of the package. Most of these datasets are ggplot2 datasets with uncertainty
    added in.
