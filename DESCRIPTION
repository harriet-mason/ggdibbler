Description: A 'ggplot2' extension for visualising uncertainty with the goal
    of signal suppression. Usually, uncertainty visualisation focuses on
    expressing uncertainty as a distribution or probability, whereas
    'ggdibbler' differentiates itself by viewing an uncertainty
    visualisation as an adjustment to an existing graphic that
    incorporates the inherent uncertainty in the estimates.  You provide
    the code for an existing plot, but replace one of the variables with a
    vector of distributions, and it will convert the visualisation into
    it's signal suppression counterpart.
