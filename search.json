Different counties can different numbers citizen scientists temperature measurements can significant amount variance due recordings made different people slightly different locations within county. recorded temperature comes county citizen scientist belongs , temperature recording made, scientist’s ID number. also variables define spatial elements county, ’s geometry, county centroid’s longitude latitude. slightly difficult, can view individual observations plotting centroid longitude latitude (little jitter) drawing counties background referece. Typically, visualise data way. much common approach take average county display choropleth map, displayed . plot fine, loose key piece information, specifically understanding mean estimate. means estimate sampling distribuiton invisible us make visualisation. can see wave like pattern data, sometimes spatial patterns result significant differences population, may disappear include variance estimates, can calculate average. Getting estimate along variance also common format governments supply data. Just like citizen scientist case, often done preserve anonymity. problem format data, way us include variance information visualisation. can visualise estimate variance separately. ggdibbler comes . ggdibbler ggplot extension allows us visulise distributions previously visualise single values.
