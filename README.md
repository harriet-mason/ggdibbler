`ggdibbler` is an R package for implementing signal suppression in
ggplot2. Usually, uncertainty visualisation focuses on expressing
uncertainty as a distribution or probability, whereas ggdibble
differentiates itself by viewing an uncertainty visualisation as a
transformation of an existing graphic that incorperates uncertainty. The
package allows you to replace any existing variable of observations in a
graphic, with a variable of distributons. It is particularly useful for
visualisations of estimates.

You provide `ggdibbler` with code for an existing plot, but repalace one
of the variables with a distribution, and it will convert the
visualisation into itâ€™s signal supression counterpart.

### Future additions to the package

The eventual goal of `ggdibbler` is to allows any distribution object to
be passed to any aesthetic in a `ggplot2` geom (so long as I have gotten
to that geom). The status of this goal is regularly updated in the [All
Geometries - Status
List](https://github.com/harriet-mason/ggdibbler/issues/28) issue.

I am happy to expedite any specific geoms that you might want, just post
a request in a github issue.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `ggdibbler` from CRAN with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
install.packages("ggdibbler")
```

or you can install the development version of ggdibbler from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("harriet-mason/ggdibbler")
```

## Examples

In essence, `ggdibbler` makes visualising uncertainty easy, as you just
replace the `geom_*` with `geom_*_sample` and replace your deterministic
variable with a `distributional` variable, and you get an uncertainty
visualisation. Woweee.

``` r
library(distributional)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggdibbler)
```

Typically, if we had an average estimate for a series of areas, we would
simply display the average, or keep the average separate. Below is an
example of this with a choropleth map.

``` r
# Make average summary of data
toy_temp_mean <- toy_temp |> 
  dplyr::group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp))

# plot it
ggplot(toy_temp_mean) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry, fill=temp_mean)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd")
```

We can use `geom_sf_sample` from the ggdibbler package to instead view
each estimate as a sample of values from its sampling distribution. If
you want to see the original geometry lines, I would recommend layering
a `geom_sf` with NA fill over the top.

``` r
set.seed(1)
# sample map
toy_temp_dist |> 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf_sample(aes(geometry = county_geometry, fill=temp_dist), linewidth=0) + 
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = county_geometry), fill=NA, linewidth=1) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" />

Currently `geom_sf` only accepts a random fill, as it subdivides the
geometry to fill it with a sample. This will eventually be extended to
all the `geom_sf` aesthetics. Other `geoms`, such as `geom_point_sample`
do accept random variables to any `aes`. You can feed any combination of
random and deterministic variables to a `geom_*_sample` layer.

``` r
point_data <- data.frame(deterministic_x = c(1,2,3),
                         uncertain_y = c(dist_gamma(2,1),
                                      dist_sample(x = list(rnorm(100, 5, 1))),
                                      dist_exponential(1)),
                         uncertain_class = dist_categorical(prob = list(c(0.8,0.15,0.05),
                                                                      c(0.25,0.7,0.05),
                                                                      c(0.25,0,0.75)),
                                                          outcomes = list(c("A", "B", "C"))))
# A geom_point with random varianles
ggplot() + 
  geom_point_sample(data = point_data, 
                    aes(x=deterministic_x, y=uncertain_y, colour = uncertain_class))
```

If you pass random variables to aesthetics like colour or label, but not
position aesthetics such as x or y, you might want to add a jitter so
that you can see all the points (otherwise you will only see one outcome
of the sample).

``` r
ggplot() + 
  geom_point_sample(data = point_data, 
                    aes(x=deterministic_x, y=deterministic_x, colour = uncertain_class),
                    position = position_jitter(width=0.1, height=0.1))
```
